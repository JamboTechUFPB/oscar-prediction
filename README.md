## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between the **Best Actress winner** at the Academy Awards (Oscar) and the influence of other major awards. By analyzing the winners over the last decade (2014-2023), the goal is to uncover patterns and trends that can help predict this year's winner using Machine Learning. 

### Key Objectives

- Analyze the last 10 years of Best Actress Oscar winners historical.
- Examine the influence of other prestigious awards.
- Train a Logistic Regression Machine Learning (ML) model to predict this yearâ€™s Best Actress at the Oscars.

## Awards Considered

The following major awards were analyzed to evaluate their influence on the Best Actress winner at the Oscars:

- **Golden Globes**

## Data Structure

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **ano**: Year of the award season  
- **nome**: Name of the actress  
- **indicada_sag**: Nominated for the SAG Awards (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **indicada_gg**: Nominated for the Golden Globe Awards (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **indicada_os**: Nominated for the Oscar (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **indicada_bafta**: Nominated for the BAFTA (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **indicada_cc**: Nominated for the Critics' Choice Awards (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **ganhou_sag**: Won the SAG Award (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **ganhou_bafta**: Won the BAFTA (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **ganhou_cc**: Won the Critics' Choice Awards (Yes [1] /No [0])  
- **ganhou_gg**: Won the Golden Globe (Yes [1] /No [0]) 
- **ganhou_os**: Won the Oscar (Yes [1] /No [0]) 

**Note**: The column `ganhou_os` (Won Academy Awards) is the target variable we are predicting.

## Machine Learning Models Used

For the prediction of the Best Actress winner, were employed:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model for binary classification, useful for predicting outcomes based on the given features.  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and model training  
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
